- name: Provision a new server with hardened SSH and basic iptables.

  # Specify the hosts you want to target
  hosts: webservers

  # Specify the user you want to connect to the server.
  # With a new installation, you will connect with `root`. If you want to
  # re-run this playbook at a later date, you should change `remote_user` to
  # the user you specified under `vars/username` below and uncomment the
  # `become: true` line. You should then run the playbook using the
  # `--ask-become-pass` flag, like so:
  # `ansible-playbook -k provision.yml --ask-become-pass`.
  #remote_user: root
  become: true

  roles:
    - ssh
    - iptables
